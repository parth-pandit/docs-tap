# Accepting EULAs and installing the Tanzu CLI

## <a id="accept-eulas"></a> Accept the End User License Agreements

Before installing packages, you must accept the End User License Agreements (EULAs).

To accept EULAs:

1. Sign in to [Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com).

2. For each of the following components, accept or confirm that you have accepted the EULA:

    - [Cluster Essentials for VMware Tanzu](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-cluster-essentials/#/releases/1011100)
    - [Tanzu Application Platform](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-application-platform/)
    - [Tanzu Build Service](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/build-service/) and its associated components:
        - [Tanzu Build Service Dependencies](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tbs-dependencies/)
        - [Buildpacks for VMware Tanzu](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-buildpacks-suite)
        - [Stacks for VMware Tanzu](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-stacks-suite)


This is an example of how to accept EULAs for Tanzu Application Platform:
After signing in to Tanzu Network, select the "Click here to sign the EULA" link in the yellow warning box under the release drop down as seen in the following screen shot. (If this warning is not there then the EULA has already been  accepted).

![EULA Warning](images/install-general-eulas1.png)

Select "Agree" in the bottom right of the dialog box that comes up as seen in the following screen shot.

![EULA Dialog Box](images/install-general-eulas2.png)

This example shows that you have now accepted the EULAs for Tanzu Application Platform. In addition, you must accept the EULAs for Cluster Essentials for VMware Tanzu and for Tanzu Build Services and its associated components as stated above.

## Installing the Tanzu CLI

This document describes how to [Set Kubernetes cluster context](#cluster-context),
[Install Cluster Essentials for VMware Tanzu](#tanzu-cluster-essentials),
and [Install or Update the Tanzu CLI and plug-ins](#cli-and-plugin) for Tanzu Application Platform:

## <a id='cluster-context'></a> Set Kubernetes cluster context

To set the Kubernetes cluster context:

1. List the existing contexts by running:

    ```
    kubectl config get-contexts
    ```

    For example:

    ```
    $ kubectl config get-contexts
    CURRENT   NAME                                CLUSTER           AUTHINFO                                NAMESPACE
            aks-repo-trial                      aks-repo-trial    clusterUser_aks-rg-01_aks-repo-trial
    *       aks-tap-cluster                     aks-tap-cluster   clusterUser_aks-rg-01_aks-tap-cluster

    ```

2.  Set the context to the cluster that you want to use for the Tanzu Application Platform packages install.
    For example, set the context to the `aks-tap-cluster` context by running:

    ```
    kubectl config use-context aks-tap-cluster
    ```

    For example:

    ```
    $ kubectl config use-context aks-tap-cluster
    Switched to context "aks-tap-cluster".
    ```

## <a id='tanzu-cluster-essentials'></a> Install Cluster Essentials for VMware Tanzu

The Tanzu Cluster Essentials package is intended to simplify the process of installing the open-source [Carvel](https://carvel.dev) tools on your cluster.
It includes a script that uses the Carvel CLI tools to download and install the server-side components `kapp-controller` and `secretgen-crontroller` on the targeted cluster.
Currently, only MacOS and Linux are supported for Cluster Essentials for VMware Tanzu.

To install cluster essentials for VMware Tanzu:

1. Sign in to [Tanzu Network](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com).

1. Navigate to [Cluster Essentials for VMware Tanzu](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/tanzu-cluster-essentials/) on VMware Tanzu Network.

1. If using macOS, download `tanzu-cluster-essentials-darwin-amd64-1.0.0.tgz`.
If using Linux, download `tanzu-cluster-essentials-linux-amd64-1.0.0.tgz`.

1. Unpack the TAR file into the `tanzu-cluster-essentials` directory by running:

    ```
    mkdir $HOME/tanzu-cluster-essentials
    tar -xvf DOWNLOADED-CLUSTER-ESSENTIALS-PACKAGE -C $HOME/tanzu-cluster-essentials
    ```

    Where `DOWNLOADED-CLUSTER-ESSENTIALS-PACKAGE` is the cluster essentials package you
    downloaded.

5. Configure and run `install.sh`, which installs kapp-controller and secretgen-controller on your cluster:

    ```
    export INSTALL_BUNDLE=registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-cluster-essentials/cluster-essentials-bundle@sha256:82dfaf70656b54dcba0d4def85ccae1578ff27054e7533d08320244af7fb0343
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME=registry.tanzu.vmware.com
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME=TANZU-NET-USER
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=TANZU-NET-PASSWORD
    cd $HOME/tanzu-cluster-essentials
    ./install.sh
    ```

    Where `TANZU-NET-USER` and `TANZU-NET-PASSWORD` are your credentials for
    VMware Tanzu Network.

6. Install the `kapp` CLI onto your `$PATH`:

    ```
    sudo cp $HOME/tanzu-cluster-essentials/kapp /usr/local/bin/kapp
    ```

    services            Discover Service Types and manage Service Instances (ALPHA)        Standalone             v0.1.1   installed
    ```

    Ensure that you have the `accelerator`, `apps`, `package`, `secret`, and `services` plug-ins.
    You need these plug-ins to install and interact with the Tanzu Application Platform.

    Tanzu Application Platform requires cluster-admin privileges.
    Running commands associated with the additional plug-ins can have unintended side effects.
    VMware recommends against running `cluster`, `kubernetes-release`, `login`, `management-cluster`,
    and `pinniped-auth` commands.

You can now proceed with installing Tanzu Application Platform. For more information, see
**[Installing the Tanzu Application Platform Package and Profiles](install.md)**.

    ```

    Expected output: `version: v0.10.0`

12. List the plug-ins to see if the `imagepullsecret` plug-in was previously installed by running:

    ```
    tanzu plugin list
    ```

    If installed, delete it by running:

    ```
    tanzu plugin delete imagepullsecret
    ```

13. Remove previously installed plug-in binaries by running:

    ```
    rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/tanzu-cli/*
    ```

14. Install new plug-in versions by running:

    ```
    tanzu plugin install --local cli all
    ```

15. Check installation status for plug-ins by running:

    ```
    tanzu plugin list
    ```

    Expect to see the following:

    ```
    tanzu plugin list
